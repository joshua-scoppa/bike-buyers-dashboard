# bike-buyers-dashboard

I cleaned up data about bike buyers' demographics using Excel formulae and functions, such as Remove Duplicates, VLOOKUP, IFS, Find and Replace, etc. 
I then found summaries and created data visualisations using Pivot Tables, which I added to a final dashboard with slicers to filter the data.

The raw data and working sheets are hidden. If you would like to see those sheets, feel free to unhide them.
